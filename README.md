# Overview

This program is a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user competes against an AI agent. The AI employs the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making method that evaluates all possible future moves and ensures optimal play.

The user plays as "X" while the AI plays as "O." Each turn, the program updates the board state, checks for a winner or a draw, and proceeds until the game concludes. The Minimax algorithm guarantees that the AI will either win or force a draw.
